# Attendance project

Python project which I had to make for my final exam in 1st year Computer Science.

There are two classes (SOFT_6017 & SOFT_6018) which have the names of students, the number of days they were present, absent with excuse and absent without excuse.

There is a login system for the lecture to login to make changes to the student's records. 

The program can also generate the statistics regarding how well each class is preforming with data such as what is the average attendance of each class
